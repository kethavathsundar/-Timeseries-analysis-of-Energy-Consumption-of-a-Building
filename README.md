ENERGY PREDICTION IN SMART BUILDING
This study details the public release of power usage and interior environmental measurement data from a seven-story, 11,700-square-meter office building in Bangkok, Thailand.

Each of the building's 33 zones has its own breakdown of power use (in kilowatt hours) for things like air conditioning, lights, and plug loads. Measurements of temperature, humidity, and lux were taken in the identical rooms using indoor environmental sensors. From July 1, 2018 until December 31, 2019.

you may get the full datasets every minute. In addition to helping with tasks like load forecasting at the zone, floor, and building levels, creating indoor thermal models, validating building simulation models, creating demand response algorithms by load type, detecting anomalies, and controlling multiple air conditioners with reinforcement learning algorithms all benefit from access to such data.

It is implemented using simple python modules such as matplotlib, Timeseries, Forecasting models and Machine learning approaches which are used to create data frames and plot different graphs.
